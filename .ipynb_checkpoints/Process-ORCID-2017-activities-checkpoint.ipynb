    "# Reading and analysing the ORCID public profiles (activities)\n",
    "This notebook describes the process of extracting and analyising data from the 2017 public data release. The analysis uses the activities extract of the profiles in JSON format (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5479792.v1).\n",
    "\n",
    "The method is based on the one used by Bohannon (2017, https://doi.org.10.1126/science.aal1189) for which dataset and scripts can be found here: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.48s16.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am initially using only the \"activities\" file as the additional data contained in the person-section of the ORCID metadata is less likely to enrich the data significantly. For example, email addresses, which would be useful in identifying affiliations based on email domains, are most likely goint to be set to private. \n",
    "However, useful information might be provided by researcher-urls (links) or alternative identifiers, where available, e.g. a link to an institutional profile. Although using education and employment affiliations is likely to provide a more complete dataset, it will be useful to test if links could be used to fill the gap for records without affiliations or to assert if an affiliation is still current (the link resolves).\n"
